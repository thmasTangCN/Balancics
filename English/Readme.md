# Oops！
Sorry,Sorry, Sorry!  
I'm still trying hard work on translating Balancics into English. Please be patient. 
<br>  

## Alternatively,  
You can start by getting the answer from Q1 in the README.md， Q&A section, You have no need to read the entire book first.  
<br>
**Just upload the Chinese version Balancics (Balancics_AiAlign.pdf in AiFile ) to AI .  
You can then ask it to clearly explain the theoretical framework of Balancics in a language you're comfortable with.**
