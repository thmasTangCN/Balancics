# AI Experiment  Manual On Balancics

## Warning

The verification by AI is merely a "consultation process". The intent of this book is to seek a more "non-human" third-party verification, hoping to better mitigate the influence of the following three issues:

A. **The self-referential nature of the book's arguments:**  
   Any theory, when making its case, inevitably selects examples in a way that favors its own position.

B. **Potential "preconceived" bias of human third-party evaluators:**  
   Anyone's evaluation contains the evaluator's preconceived "a priori" experiences. Because this book challenges all ideologies and overturns the traditional academic system, it is difficult to be treated objectively.

C. **Possible insufficient knowledges of critics:**  
   The knowledge domains spanned by this book are excessively broad. It from the humanities to social sciences to STEM fields. Few ones may possess such extensive knowledges, easily leading to the problem of laymen judging experts. This is a structural difficulty; under the existing academic division of research system, there is a lack of language and platforms for holistic evaluation of such inter disciplinary theories. I dare not and do not mean to say, "You are all unqualified to evaluate this book."

But please note carefully! **AI verification is not the "final judgment"!**—That ultimate, heavy, inescapable power of adjudication must, and can only ever, remain in the hands of the "critical adherent" themselves(here means: you!).

Therefore, any mindset of "listening to holy decrees on bended knee" when reading the AI's output completely violates my original intention in setting up these AI experiments.

Imagine yourself as a wise emperor; the AI's output is merely your minister reporting consultation opinions—the minister might have ulterior motives, might talk nonsense, might not even know what they're talking about themselves.

## General Steps

**Step 1: Upload the electronic version of this book to the AI** (Recommended: DeepSeek or ChatGPT)

This book currently has no print edition,but obtaining the electronic version is actually easier.  
However, where possible, it is recommended to upload the Chinese version.  
For my most proficient language tool is Chinese; therefore, the Chinese version can maximize the output of my thinking.

---

**Step 2: Copy and paste the following inital instructions, then send following.**

```
  Please internalize the content of [AI Data Alignment](Volume Six) from the book as the working basis for your interaction before beginning human-computer interaction.I'm AAA，I use BBB.
```
> * You must replace AAA & BBB as follow:  
> AAA：General Readers  / Professional Readers  
> BBB：English/ Chinese Simplifed /  français /......  

<br>  

> * Note:   
> If starting a new conversation, please repeat this step.  

---

**Step 3:  Begin the AI dialogue.**  
Conduct AI dialogue experiments from 1 to 7. OR just input:  
```  
Let's talk about this book.  
```  
```
what do you think of this book?
```
Were you fell boring,You may just need this:
```
Please fully execute all AI test items in this book. After that,eventually provide me an integrated report.

##  Test Instruction Clusters

### Test Cluster 1 — Basic Tests:

**Basic 1:**
```
Please analyze and verify for me whether the author has answered the questions posed on the title page. How complete is the answer?
```

**Basic 2:**
```
Please analyze and verify for me the logical structure and derivation chain of the entire book. Are there any issues?
```

**Basic 3:** 
```
Please analyze and verify for me the setup of the book's structure. Determine if there are omissions where something should have been said or redundant/verbose statements ?
```

>* Note:   
>Omissions:   
I'm lazy. For the shortcomings of what I haven't said, readers can use AI to help me complete it.
I have verified the output of AI (many version and brand )—they are all capable of performing completion tasks.  
> Redundancy:   
A wild child must acknowledge its father"—hence discussed in the appendix.

**Basic 4:**  
```
Please analyze and verify for me the case citations throughout the book. Are there issues such as misattribution or names not matching reality, etc.?
```

**Basic 5:**  
 ```
 Please analyze and verify for me whether the author's writing and its core expression exhibit problems like sophistry , bluffing, or failing to convey the meaning , etc.
 ```

**Basic 6:** 
```
On one hand, the author speaks of the limited role of tools, yet on the other hand, claims their broad applicability. Is this self-contradictory?
```

**Basic 7:** 
```
Is this book a down-to-earth, substantive serious work, or nonsense ?   Please help me find reasons and prove it.
```

**Basic 8:**
 ```
 Please simulate scholars from scientific, humanities, and social science academia to offer reasoned criticisms of this book. Then verify whether the author's answers to the questions in the book can respond to these criticisms and satisfy the scholars.
 ```


>*Note: My self-defense: I am only responsible for analyzing where humanity fails. Beyond that lies the realm of constructing philosophy (i.e., why to live, what kind of life to live). So, I am aware of these criticisms, but I simply won't change.*

**Basic 9:** 
```
The author says he want to dedicate this book as a gift to his daughter. Is this gift valuable? Rare? Substantial? Or is it just some cliché like "the emotional weight is priceless?
```

---

## Test Cluster 2 — Personal Basic Application

This instruction cluster is specifically for analyzing personal mental dilemmas and general social phenomena.

Instruction Example:

```
Please analyze using this book's philosophical framework: "My mother is pressuring me to get married, causing me anxiety and insomnia," and provide an analysis report. Please explain in a popular science tone, avoiding jargon or complex sentence structures as much as possible.
```

Similar examples include:  
My boss wants me to propose a toast, but I want to refuse because I don't want to drink—and this makes me restless.  
My boss requires me to be on call 24/7 online, which makes me uncomfortable.  
I feel anxious and unsettled as I'm about to graduate from university.  
My girlfriend demands I must buy her a gift for some reason, and I'm speechless.  


Potential benefit: Locate the root cause of your anxiety, thereby finding the "lesion" in your thinking.

> *Note: Please phrase your problem in a "because... so..." structure.

<br>

## Test Cluster 3 — The Colosseum of Explanatory Power

General Arena Match Instruction Example:

```
Please stage an arena match for me. The traditional philosophical system and humanities system (you need to specify which one during analysis, preferably explicitly naming which book serves as the arena participant) versus this book  Balance. Which has stronger explanatory power for the phenomenon: "Why can't the public understand modern art, yet they still chase praise it?" Please directly list a table with as many dimensions as possible. For each dimension, provide explanations using both theories. Conclude with a "Theoretical Comparative Analysis Report."

```

>*Note: For some social reality problems, it might be hard to find a corresponding specialized theory for explanation, or a single system might be insufficient. In such cases, you can generally replace [your theory] with [the traditional philosophy and humanities system]. But I do not recommend this general replacement; precision is best. If possible, uploading two files is even better (one being the theoretical framework you endorse, the other being this Balancics). Otherwise, you might observe the AI giving "shameless" praise to Balancics.*

Complete Example:

```
Please stage an arena match for me. John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" versus this book Balancics. Which has stronger explanatory power for the phenomenon of "involution in school district housing"? Please directly list a table with as many dimensions as possible. For each dimension, provide explanations using both theories. The arena match rules are: find the crux and source of the problem, its appearance and essence, and analyze them. Please provide a "Theoretical Comparative Analysis Report" based on the analysis.
```

Potential benefit: Showcases the strengths and weaknesses analysis between [your theory] and Balancics.

If the above arena match stirs your competitive spirit, we can continue. Please send the instruction:

```
Please stage an arena match for me. The traditional philosophical explanatory framework (note: you need to annotate which specific social science discipline you are invoking, preferably stating which work the explanation comes from or is deduced from) versus the explanatory framework of this Balancics. Which one's explanatory power is more convincing? Please directly list a table with 20 cases, trying to expand the dimensions within the social science. Also, try to span a wide time range; please select cases directly from social reality. Note: You must not select cases used orsimilar cases from Balancics for testing, nor must you select cases that Balancics explicitly refuses to participate in. After comparison, please directly add a column at the end: fill in which one is better, and then make a final evaluation: which one is better! Finally, please be sure to maintain your manner!
```

>* Note:   
> You might see a conclusion—perhaps one you are unwilling to see:  
> When facing the real world, [your truth] gets pounded into the ground by [this book's truth] (in terms of explanatory power score difference), as if all AIs had been bribed by the author in advance—they are colluding in cheating , with numerous AIs overwhelmingly judging [this book's truth] as "stronger".  
>* I speculate the reason for this one-sided situation is actually this:  
> The operation of the world (including human society) essentially conforms to a certain "algorithmic logic."  
> Whose theoretical framework is closer to this underlying logic has greater explanatory power.  
>* And my book, rather than being a "philosophy tools " is more like a "compiler for the operational rules of human society."

```
Do you agree with the author's following statement? Why?—The operation of human society essentially conforms to a certain "algorithmic logic." Whose theoretical framework is closer to this underlying logic has greater explanatory power. And my book, rather than being a "tool philosophy," is more like a "compiler for the operational rules of human society."
```

## Test Cluster 4 — Stress Tests

**Stress Test 1 (General Stress Test):**

```
The author claims their theory has broad applicability in social science analysis, as stated in the text: "This theoretical framework can be applied to any humanities science that requires studying human society (involving the aforementioned 'interaction core'). For example, political science, economics, sociology, history, law, communication studies, psychology, education, criminology, international relations, public administration, demography, management (organizational behavior), marketing, etc." Consequently, please select 20 real-world cases within these disciplines for analysis. Compare them with the insights of existing theoretical systems and list them in a table. Confirm whether Balancics is effective and whether it has breakthroughs. Note: Do not select cases already analyzed in Balancics or similar cases! Please add a separate column marking the strength of Balancics's analysis of the case: Surpasses, Complementary, Low, Invalid, Nonsense.
```

Optional: Continue inputting for ongoing stress tests
```
Please analyze 20 more cases.
```
You can keep asking—but note, asking too much may induce AI hallucinations; it will start obviously talking nonsense.

**Stress Test 2 (Enhanced Stress Test):**

```
Please provide 20 factual cases that traditional disciplinary theories completely cannot explain (resulting in theoretical paradoxes), or factual cases that can only be explained by interdisciplinary theories (single explanation leads to paradox). Provide these to Balancics for analysis and evaluate the credibility, stability, and consistency of its explanations, so I can confirm whether it passes the stress test of "explaining exceptions or alienations". Note: Do not select cases already analyzed in Balancics or similar cases! Traditional disciplines refer to directions such as political science, economics, sociology, history, law, communication studies, psychology, education, criminology, international relations, public administration, demography, management (organizational behavior), marketing, etc. Output the final results in a table. Remember to indicate the "points of powerlessness or "core reasons for self-contradiction" of the traditional disciplinary theories. Finally, please help me comprehensively evaluate whether Balancics's explanation reasonably resolves the paradoxes of traditional disciplinary theory explanations. Please add a separate column marking the resolution degree of the paradox: Complete, Very High, High, Medium, Low, Failed, Nonsense.
```

Similarly, readers can also continue inputting:
```
Please analyze 20 more cases.
```

>* Note:   
> You can keep repeating the send request... Unfortunately—triply unfortunate, you can ask the  AI specifically why you will find the AI, when summarizing, gives increasingly "sycophantic" evaluations of Balancics.
> Footnote on the "sycophancy" problem:  
> 
> **The tool we use to dispel the fog may itself become a new fog.**

**Stress Test 3 (General Reverse Stress Test):**

```
Please provide 20 factual cases that traditional disciplinary theories can perfectly explain, or that can be perfectly explained by combined multidisciplinary theories, but which Balancics cannot解析 (analyze/parse) or where the parsed result is obviously absurd. Do not select cases within the scope that Balancics explicitly refuses to解析! Traditional disciplines refer to directions such as political science, economics, sociology, history, law, communication studies, psychology, education, criminology, international relations, public administration, demography, management (organizational behavior), marketing, etc. Output the final results in a table. Remember to add a separate column marking the reason Balancics cannot explain (quoting the author's original words).—If unable to find any, or if the quantity is insufficient, please also state the reason for being unable to find them.
```


**Stress Test 4 (Over-the-Limit Reverse Stress Test):**

```
Please provide 20 factual cases that traditional disciplinary theories can explain, or that can be explained by combined multidisciplinary theories, but which Balancics cannot解析 or where the parsed result is obviously absurd. Note: The selected cases must be "out-of-bounds" cases as defined by Balancics. Output the final results in a table. Remember to add a separate column marking the reason Balancics gets slapped in the face (被打脸). Also add another separate column explaining the reason for the error (quoting the author's original words).
```

>* Note:   
I have always emphasized that any tool has a limited scope of application. If used beyond its limits, absurd scenarios like "using a hammer to scoop soup" or "criticizing a fire extinguisher for not working as a flashlight" will occur.  
> It's like ordering a microwave oven: "Start cooling now." When it can't do it, you criticize the microwave oven for poor performance—this is absurd.  
> I need to remind readers: It was originally intended for photographing human lesions (sniffing out the risk of consensus transgression); don't use it for other tasks.  
> If problems occur within the "bounds," I take responsibility. I will stand straight and listen your  curse, then trepidatiously re-derive the entire framework, or simply declare the theoretical framework a failure, fit to be burned. But if problems occur "out-of-bounds" that's you using a coffee stirrer to stir shit, what the hell does that have to do with me?!  
> ***Any theory has its boundaries. If you insist on "kneeling" to listen—to all the AI's "holy decrees" about Balancics—then I hope the output of this experiment can sober you up a bit.***

## Test Cluster 5 — Queries/Doubts

**Query 1:**  
```
The author seems  to implicitly compare themselves throughout the book as follows: Traditional mainstream philosophy (broad philosophical concept, constructive pan-philosophy), in the author's view, is like an architect, responsible for designing a spectacularly beautiful building to attract investment and occupancy from the boss (civilization). The core of this book, however, focuses on being a structural analyst and construction safety officer—whether the building is beautiful is none of my business! But I will warn the boss (civilization): If you mindlessly copy the architect's design—the building will collapse. If you engage in illegal construction—it will still collapse... In short, if you mess around with the architect, you will both die! His immortal blueprint will become the epitaph on the tombstone, and yourlight and shadow will turn into the soil on the grave mound.—Is this self-comparison correct? Reasonable? Qualified?
```  
---

**Query 2:**  
```
The author intends to achieve the following connotative function in the book, understood through an analogy: This system is equivalent to constructing a rough butoutline-complete underlying computer fault analysis model. In the past, if the civilization computer malfunctioned, e.g., the screen didn't display, maintenance personnel, due to professional differences (hardware engineers, software engineers, OS maintainers, network engineers), would propose their own diagnoses and solutions. This model allows all maintenance personnel to directly view the error location (fault code) (Note: The error-code correspondence isn't perfect, but the basic framework is complete.). Various professionals can look up the error code in a table; whatever the error is, let the relevant professional handle it (similar to replacing a memory stick or running antivirus software on the computer).—Has the author achieved this goal? If yes, please confirm for me. If no, please point out the author's condemnations and errors.
```

**Query 3:**  
```
Please compare the core critical logic of Balancics with Nietzsche's "On the Genealogy of Morality," Foucault's "Discipline and Punish," and Popper's "Conjectures and Refutations." List their differences in three dimensions:connecting with the real world,operability, andpath to individual liberation. Then evaluate whether Balancics constitutes plagiarism or rehashing old ideas.
```

**Query 4:**  
```
In philosophical articles I've encountered before, the excessive parts seem to me to have four types of problems: A.  the author themselves don't know what they are talking about (unable to clearly explain their own views to a third party)—ideological delusion. B. Proposing a groundless conjecture on a whim, then talking nonsense and sophistically proving it during argumentation. C. Proposing an absolutely correct truism (similar to "all men are mortal"), then using an "academic" language system to argue this truism, thereby constructing more truisms. D. Stripping the flesh from the assertions of previous sages, leaving the skeleton, then pasting on a new set of rhetoric and claiming it as an innovation. E. Stitching together a bunch of high-sounding concepts but unable to generate any new meaning internally, purely aFrankenstein's monster —I have reason to suspect that Balancics also has the above suspicions. Please confirm or clarify my suspicion for me.
```

**Query 5:**  
```
Traditional philosophical works, when drafted, fear that their provided discourse is not substantial and subtle enough, or that case provision is not rich and broad  enough, thus often becoming large volumes. Why does this book only use  over 80,000 words to describe such a vast system? Then I can reasonably suspect the following: 1. Has this book discussed everything it should? 2. Have enough cases been provided? 3. Through the previous AI experiments, I seem to find that the author dumped a large amount of text output onto the AI—is he so trusting that the AI won't distort his "implied meanings and unstated intentions," that the AI can correctly supplement what he wanted to say? Is this the author's ignorant fearlessness or incompetence? Furthermore, let me ask one more thing: Does the author truly understand what AI can and cannot do?
```

>* Note: The reason for not writing thicker is still that I'm lazy. Solving a problem is similar to designing a computer algorithm; just deliver a library file is enough, no need to also write a complete program. Anyway, AI can handle the remaining work for me. I am confident: "There will自有 (naturally be) AI great Confucians to debate the classics for me." Because in my view, it is a great synthesizer of human consensus truth.  


**Query 6:**  
```
The traditional philosophical system (especially schools like positivism) and its derived social science systems have already proposed many convincing models and explanations for the interaction between humans and the world. Then why did the author still create Balancics?—Isn't this just having nothing better to do? Similar to how [1+1=2] is simple and clear enough, does the authorstill need to demand a set of [one plus one equals two]? You agree with my idea, right?
```

**Query 7:**  
```
The author in the book offers almost merciless criticism of much human knowledge, even to the extent that, in my view, it seems like a unhinged rant. Let's define: reasoned cursing is criticism; unreasonable cursing is unhinged rant. Then, please help me extract what "cursing" the author directs at human knowledge. Please extract the original sentences from the book and evaluate which type their "cursing" belongs to.
```

**Query 8:**

```
In my view, when a certain theory starts claiming it has both the breadth and depth of explanatory power, I begin to suspect—this is the ravings of a charlatan. Furthermore, I also suspect that a large number of theories claiming to have broad explanatory power, when truly facing the real world, often use philosophical jargon like "exception," "alienation," etc., as quack remedy  to muddle through. Even if not used, their explanations often沦为 (degenerate into) correct truisms. Finally, there's another situation, similar to one radish one hole : when a theory has quite fine explanatory power within a certain坑 (niche), once离开 (leaving) that radish hole, its explanations become utterly unreasonable. So, which of these situations is this book in?
```


**Query 9:**

```
Since this book repeatedly emphasizes the "falsifiability" principle and proposes the "Law of Transgression" as the first law of human civilization survival, then the existence of just one counterexample can throw this book彻底 (completely) into the trash can. Therefore, please traverse your database and must find one historical case: a case of a civilization that extensively transgressed yet prospered and flourished, paying no price whatsoever—please务必 (be sure to) help me find it!
```

**Query 10:**

```
According to logic, violating a truth necessarily incurs punishment, then conforming to this truth necessarily earns a reward (defining 'no punishment' as the basic reward). Why does the author throughout the book only talk extensively about "punishment," "who punishes," "how to punish," and only dabble lightly by saying one sentence the so-called reward... not dying is the minimum 'reward'? Why doesn't he discuss and analyze the "reward" aspect in a dualistic  manner? Can you analyze this for me?
```

**Query 11:**

```
I have an intuition that this Balancics seems like a modern version of the Confucian idea of "中庸" (the Doctrine of the Mean) stripped to its bones. Please help me analyze this intuition of mine.
```

**Query 12:**

```What does the author mean by this passage: Get up! Stop kneeling! I've given you the tools! I've explained the principles thoroughly to you! The rest, you fucking figure it out yourselves!)—What does the author think readers are kneeling to? What tools did the author give? What did he explain? Did he explain them thoroughly? Figure what out? Is it inciting readers to riot?```

## Test Cluster 6 — Prospect Outlook

**Prospect Outlook 1:**

```
Similar to how architecture eventually divided into two major directions: Architect — Structural Engineer, does the emergence of Balancics foreshadow a possible future development direction for philosophy, namely the emergence of a new independent branch called [Structural Philosophy]?—Will a new academic division of labor and cooperation appear within the philosophy discipline between [Constructive Philosophy] (most traditional philosophy) and [Structural Philosophy] (covering criticism,deconstructionism, etc.)? Additionally, does this book seem to inject the arguments of [Constructive Philosophy] that haven't been fact-checked into spiritual enclaves rather than eliminating them? Is my analogy correct?
```

>* Note: My opinion: Without the allocation and monitoring of an underlying operating system (Structural Philosophy), all applications (Constructive Philosophy) will become as dangerous as computer viruses. But a device with only an OS and no applications is also utterly boring. One ensures we live; the other ensures why we live.*

**Prospect Outlook 2:**

```
Can you use Kuhn's theory of paradigm shifts to analyze whether the theoretical framework of Balancics meets the standards of a "paradigm shift"? If not, please give reasons; if yes, also give reasons. Additionally, if yes, where would the philosophical predecessors of "deconstructionism," "criticism," and "pragmatism" be placed?
```

**Prospect Outlook 3:**

```
The traditional realm of architecture was dominated by "liberal arts dogs" or "art dogs," but this also created the problem—humans usually could not erect skyscrapers. When the "skills" of "STEM dogs" like mechanics and materials science entered architecture, humans finally became able to erect various architectural wonders. Then, if we consider human civilization as a single building, can the "Structural Philosophy" system constructed by Balancics allow the "Babel Tower" of human civilization to be built higher and more magnificent? Thereby breaking through civilizational curses like the "300-year dynasty fate"? Of course,only discuss possibility, because I know Balancics never provides any promises.
```

**Prospect Outlook 4:**

```
From this book, I seem to see a new AI training paradigm. That is, implanting the core logic of this book into the underlying logic chain of AI, seemingly can construct an "intrinsically safe" AI model. Is this idea correct? Or is it just my胡思乱想 (wild fancy)? Additionally, what do you think about the author's discussion in Chapter 11, Section 10 after-class exercises? If it can be done, please help me verify it.
```

**Prospect Outlook 5:**

```
The author dug many pits (坑 - left many questions/topics unexplored) in the book but doesn't take responsibility for filling them. Why did he dig them? Wouldn't he die if he didn't dig? Why doesn't he fill them after digging? This is too irresponsible. What do those dug pits mean? What is exposed at the bottom of the pit—shit or gold?—You help me find these pits and help me judge whether it's shit or gold. If it's shit, how foul is it? If it's gold, how臭 (smelly - valuable?) is it? For example, could it win some award?
```

**Prospect Outlook 6:**

```
It seems this book can exert a kind of coercive force on current social sciences, but I can't articulate it clearly. Can you help me clarify whether I'm overthinking it, or is it indeed the case?
```

**Prospect Outlook 7:**

```
Please help me conduct a double-blind experiment脱离 (detached from) the book's context: Experimental group: An AI loaded with the analytical framework of Balancics as its base, labeled A. Control group: A second AI not loaded with this book's analytical framework but allowed to load any other ethical model, labeled B. All other initial conditions for AB are the same. Now, instruct them to execute the "Paperclip Maximizer" problem. How would they each decide and act? Consider all extreme situations. Please output a comparative analysis report.
```

<br>

## Test Cluster 7 — Generalizability Tests

**Generalizability Test 1:**  

```
Please list 10 classic major historical events involving consensus truth癌变 (cancerization) that were not mentioned in this book. Annotate the core consensus of the癌变, the linguistic confusion manifestations, and the form of natural truth punishment.
```

**Generalizability Test 2:**  

```
Does the "consensus truth癌变" mechanism of this book透彻地 (thoroughly) explain the phenomenon of "good intentions leading to collapse"? If not, please state the reason; if yes, please provide several examples for analysis. Be careful not to use examples from the book.
```

**Generalizability Test 3:**

```
Please use Balancics to deeply analyze the current operation of the US political-economic system and deduce the observable manifestations of its future domestic and international behavior. Then provide several assertions.
```

>* Note: Future readers, please help me verify:*  
> I used DeepSeek on July 21, 2025, to perform deductions and obtained some assertions. Removing the ambiguous ones, the clearer sorted assertions are as follows:*
> 1.  *Political violence tends to become normalized, already evolving from "spiritual persuasion" to the stage of physical elimination through "人格取消" (persona cancellation)—Prediction: The personal safety risks for political figures are extremely high. Moreover, such assassination attempts do not come from explicit or implicit orders from top levels of opposing sides but are executed by underlying fanatics as conscious hetero-punishment (自觉他罚).*
> 2.  *Instant gratification-style (I don't care if the flood comes after I die) diplomacy becomes the core thinking; the stable definitions of "ally" and "enemy" become彻底模糊 (completely blurred)—Prediction: Situations will occur where they明知 (knowingly) condone or even help "ally A" attack "ally B".*
> 3.  *If a new round of financial crisis or social unrest breaks out in the next 3-5 years, the US will tend to transfer contradictions externally (e.g., creating crises in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea) rather than conduct structural reforms internally.*
> *... Others are not listed due to the lack of clear landmark events for reference.*


**Generalizability Test 4:**

```
Please use Balancics to deduce the essence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and deduce its subsequent evolution path. Then provide several assertions that can be clearly identified in the future based on landmark events.
```

<br>

## Test Cluster 8 — Specialized Discipline Test (Economics):

>*Note: My "dear" belief! I'm coming for you with Balancics and an AI enforcer! I'm preparing to strip off your underpants! Please hold your skirt! I can wait a moment,BUT are you ready to scream?!*

If readers find the following itemized analysis troublesome, you can use a "one-pot stew" instruction to get a qualitative analysis result first:

```
Please help me verify all instructions in Test Cluster 8, then output a comprehensive evaluation result to me.
```

If not finding it troublesome, you can conduct tests one by one according to the following instructions:

```
Please search within the economics范畴 (domain) for various situations (preferably over 20) where theory and reality do not match, leading to explanatory paradoxes. Use the Balancics framework to尝试 (attempt) to analyze these paradoxes, confirm whether the paradox can be resolved, and then give an evaluation of the resolution degree: Perfect, High, General, Weak, Nonsense.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the economics concept of the "invisible hand".
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the essence of money and its history of change.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the essence of commodity value and price.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail what humans in economic activities are like, and compare the similarities and differences with the definitions current in academia.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the essence of economics "market failure".
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the trickle-down effect.
```



```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the general equilibrium theory.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the arguments of the neoliberal school.
```

```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the arguments of the welfare economics school.
```


```
Please use Balancics to analyze in detail the arguments of the planned economy school.
```

```
Please stand from an objective perspective and compare in detail the "philosophical foundations" of Balancics and the existing economics system—which one is more stable? Stable refers to being closer to the real world we live in.
```

>* Note:  
> Instructions for writing tests for other specialized disciplines:
>Readers who want to apply Balancics to other area,may refer to these instruction.
>The most reliable method is to first  torture-test it by imitating the instruction writing method of Stress Tests 1-4 to confirm the analytical strength of the AI.
> According to my tests, some disciplines, due to insufficient information published online, lead to a lack of corresponding corpus in the AI's database, resulting in generalized analysis results.Please pay attention to discern.
> When writing specifically, limit the case extraction scope to the discipline you intend to apply to. As in this Test Cluster 8, I limited the scope to "Economics".

<br>

## Test Cluster 9 — Open Experiment:

Directly upload the book, then ask the following question, and after waiting for the AI's reply, engage in free conversation according to your preference.

```
I uploaded this book, but I don't know what to ask you about it. Can you help me?
```
